The main obejctive of this project is to build an image recognition algorithm that detects vehicles and pedestrians for autonomous driving use case with **mAP >= 0.5**.


### STAGE 1 : Classifier 
Train a classifier for one class of objects like Pedestrian or Vehicles.

### STAGE 2. Detection 
Attach a detection network to an already trained classifier and then again train for detection.

### STAGE 3. Repeat the above stages for the remaining class of objects
After satisfactory performance and standards in stage 1 and 2, build similar networks for the remaining class of objects.
